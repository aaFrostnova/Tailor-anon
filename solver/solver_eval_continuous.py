"""M2 solver-level evaluation against the CONTINUOUS solver and the measured canonical surrogate.

Mirrors solver_eval.py's scenario distribution (same grid, weights and seed) so the two are
comparable, but every configuration -- the solver's and every fixed baseline's -- is scored through
the measured surrogate, with strengths continuous for the solver and pinned for the baselines.

Two things differ from the discrete harness, both forced by the model rather than chosen:
  * There is no brute-force oracle. A strength is a real number, so "enumerate every configuration"
    does not exist; the enumeration comparison lives in the necessity experiment instead.
  * Fidelity comes back as a distortion in MSE and is converted to dB here, since the surrogate
    objective is -D and only the conversion makes it comparable to a dB floor.

Usage: python solver_eval_continuous.py <shard_idx> <n_shards> [N=2000]
Writes one shard of per-scenario records; merge with merge_solver_eval.py.
