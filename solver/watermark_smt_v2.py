    beta was previously a free knob, which left the feasibility rule unanchored: 0.75 corresponds to

    what the decoder actually does. Acceptance is the disjunction of

      identity  -- BCH(n, k, t) decodes and reproduces the expected payload, which needs at most t bit
                   errors, i.e. per-image accuracy >= (n - t)/n, and false-accepts at a fixed 2^-k;

                   spent at tau(b) = (ppf(1 - b, n, 1/2) + 1)/n.

    Since the deployment accepts on the disjunction, the two budgets add. The identity test's cost is
    fixed and cannot be tuned, so it is charged first and the presence test spends the remainder:

        alpha <  2^-k : not even the identity test fits, and no configuration can meet the request;
        alpha >= 2^-k : identity is on, presence gets alpha - 2^-k, and beta is whichever of the two
                        thresholds is cheaper -- min((n-t)/n, tau(alpha - 2^-k)).

    Loosening alpha therefore lowers beta continuously through the presence threshold; tightening it
    raises beta until the presence test is priced out, at which point beta stops at the code's
    correction limit, because past that it is the code and not the threshold that bounds the error.

# `resolution` is therefore a DECLARED-BUT-GATED input: build() accepts it, and refuses any value that
# has no measured table rather than silently answering with 512 numbers. Populate RES_TABLES (and drop
# the guard) once the per-resolution campaign lands -- it must supply per-res attack bit-acc AND
# per-res PSNR, latency and stacking penalty, since quality and runtime constraints consume those too.
# Evidence (res_invariance_pilot.json n=50 + res_campaign.json n=50, TOST margin 0.02):
#   * GEOMETRY (crop75/crop50/rot9) is resolution-INVARIANT at every R tested -- the 512 cells transfer.
#   * SIGNAL (jpeg/blur/noise/clean) transfers for R>=512 but BREAKS at 256 (VINE/blur -0.044,
#     TrustMark/jpeg -0.036, VideoSeal -0.14..-0.17): the mark is small relative to fixed-PIXEL attacks.
#   * VAE breaks at 256 for every fragment (-0.03 VINE .. -0.29 VideoSeal); fine for R>=1024.
#   * DIFFUSION/ADVERSARIAL (regen/rinse/ctrlregen*/unmarker) are NOT measured at any R != 512.
#   * VideoSeal has NO native-resolution path (0/50 preserved at every R != 512), so its non-512 cells
#     are a forced-resize artifact; VINE and TrustMark preserve native resolution 50/50.

    The retired live_required() answered the same question from a fixed operating point (BA_full), which
    is not the number a request's verdict rests on. This takes `table_value`: what the solve actually
    read for the configuration it returned, under the front-end stage it turned on. Two reasons to
    refuse the table:

      adversarial      UnMarker optimises against the image in front of it, so the offline mean is the
                       attacker's success rate on OTHER images. Measured on the certified C4 requests:
                       four of nine cleared the mean threshold with per-image detection 0.30 to 0.80,
                       i.e. the request passed while most single images did not.
      near-threshold   a certified optimum sits ON the constraint, so when the table value is within
                       k image-to-image standard deviations of the threshold the specific image can land
                       on either side. Measured: of the cells that clear the mean, 9% of the benign ones
                       have per-image detection below 0.90, against 52% of the diffusion ones.

    Returns (required, reason). The caller decides what to do with a required cell it cannot execute:

        The coverage clause compares a MEAN bit accuracy against a threshold. The deployment accepts each
        image on its own, so the quantity a request needs is the fraction of images that clear its
        threshold, and the mean cannot stand in for it when the per-image distribution is bimodal
        (UnMarker under the ring at strength 0.3: mean 0.694, half the images at 0.99 and half at chance)
        or merely sits on the threshold, which a certified optimum does. Measured on the certified C4
        requests: four of nine cleared the mean UnMarker threshold and detected 0.30 to 0.80 of the images.

        The threshold FOLLOWS THE FRAGMENT COUNT, exactly as the coverage clause's does: a k-fragment
        configuration runs k+1 zero-bit tests inside one budget, so each test is charged budget/(k+1),
        and a single fragment is charged nothing of the sort. Using the three-fragment threshold
        throughout, as the first version did, charges a multiplicity that is not spent: on VINE under
        CtrlRegen+ at step 0.5 it moved the line from 0.630 to 0.660, which turned "91% of images clear
        it at strength 0.9" into "no strength is enough", and single-fragment C4 paid it on every request.

        The rate comes from the stored PER-IMAGE values (surrogate.rate_curve) rather than from a stored
        curve, because no stored curve could be the right one for every budget and count. With a stage on,
        the stage's own per-image cell is read; where there is none and the stage does not change this
        fragment's embed (FE_AFFECTS), the plain per-image cell stands, since it is the same embed at the
        request's threshold; where the stage does change the embed and no per-image cell describes it,
        the fragment gets no credit under that stage (no evidence, no credit). The det_fe_* curves of
        the front-end campaign (rates at the decoder's default 1% budget) are records only: not read.
