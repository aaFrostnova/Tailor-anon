"""Merge every measured surrogate piece into ONE canonical table the solver and the live layer read.

Inputs (all measured on pool E, N=100 for the in-process family and N=50 for the diffusion family):
  surrogate_table_ext.json              base/delta/d/e for the 10 in-process attacks, plus the
                                        strength-dependent capacity curves and the front-end curves
  surrogate_regen_overlay_ext.json      regen (6/6 ordered-pair deltas) and rinse (2/6, see below)
  surrogate_ctrlregen_s03_overlay.json  ctrlregen at diffusion step 0.3
  surrogate_ctrlregen_s07_overlay.json  ctrlregen at diffusion step 0.7

Any ordered pair an overlay did not measure is filled with an explicit ZERO interference curve and
listed under "zero_filled_delta" -- the solver needs a value for every (g,f,a) it can query, and
"no measured interference" is the honest default, but it must be visible rather than silent.
