"""The single definition of every attack, shared by the measurement campaigns and the reported matrix.

An attack that is implemented twice is two attacks. This module exists because they had drifted: the
in-process surrogate campaigns restated the operators locally, and the restatements disagreed with the
ones the reported matrix uses -- crop read its fraction as an area rather than a side, rotation filled
the corners with black instead of reflecting, and the photometric and noise attacks were substantially
milder (brightness measured 23.9 dB against the cover where the reported operator measures 11.5 dB).
The solver was therefore planning against a weaker threat than the evaluation scored it on, and nothing
in either program could notice, because both were internally consistent.

Everything here is PIL-in / PIL-out so a campaign can call it in-process, while `attack_file` keeps the
path-based form the evaluation harness uses. The two share one implementation, so they cannot diverge.
